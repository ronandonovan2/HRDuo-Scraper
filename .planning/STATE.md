## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Setup: Playwright chosen over Puppeteer for SPA handling (auto-wait, active maintenance)
- Setup: GitHub Actions for scheduling — free, no server to maintain
- Setup: JSON file + JS snippet chosen over WordPress REST API + ACF (simpler, fewer moving parts)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: HR Duo page DOM structure unknown until site is inspected live — scraper selectors need real page inspection before writing stable code
